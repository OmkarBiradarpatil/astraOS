# Contributing to AstraOS

We love your input! We want to make contributing to AstraOS as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Pull Request Process

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `develop`.
2. Map your branch name to the convention: `feature/<name>`, `fix/<name>`, `refactor/<name>`, or `docs/<name>`.
3. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
4. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
5. Ensure the test suite passes (`npm run test`).
6. Make sure your code lints (`npm run lint`).
7. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](LICENSE) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.
