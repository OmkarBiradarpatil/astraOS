# AstraOS

> The Next-Generation Web Operating System Platform

## Problem

Traditional web applications force users into scattered workflows. Managing tools, files, and communications requires constant context-switching across isolated tabs.

## Solution

AstraOS unifies the web experience into a single, cohesive, high-performance operating system interface directly in the browser—empowering users with seamless multitasking and advanced window management.

## Key Features

- **Windowed Multitasking**: Run multiple apps side-by-side.
- **Unified File System**: Manage all your virtual assets in one place.
- **Real-Time Collaboration**: Built-in messaging and shared sessions.
- **Extensible Architecture**: Easily add and build new native AstraOS applications.

## Tech Stack

- Frontend: React 19, Vite, Tailwind CSS (optional), Lucide Icons
- Architecture: Component-driven UI with robust context management

## Architecture Overview

AstraOS is structured into a scalable, full-stack micro-architecture dividing the visual representation (`astraos-webapp` and `astraos-dashboard`) and core modules.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/astraOS.git
cd astraOS/astraos-webapp
npm install
npm run dev
```
